# IA368---Machine-Learning-Topics
Repository for the grad school subject that I took on the first semester of 2023.

On the final project of this subject, we compared the performance of a range of Machine Learning Techniques (MLP Neural Networks and K-nearest Neighbors) with multiple parameters on the classification task of the publicly available Breast Cancer Winsconcin Dataset. Furthermore, we also applied genetic algorithms to try and select the features that were most important for the classification task. Here you can file the code files for each technique that was employed during this task.

For our presentation, we wrote a report (Trabalho_IA368, which you can read here in portuguese) using the model of a scientific article in order to publish and discuss our results with the rest of the class.
