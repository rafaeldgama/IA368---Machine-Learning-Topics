# IA368---Machine-Learning-Topics
Repository for the grad school subject that I took on the first semester of 2023.

On the final project of this subject, we compared the performance of a range of Machine Learning Techniques (MLP Neural Networks and K-nearest Neighbors) with multiple parameters on the classification task of publicly available Breast Cancer Winsconcin Dataset. Furthermore, we also applied genetic algorithms to try and select the features that were most important for the classification task.

For our presentation, we wrote a report (which you can read here in portuguese) on the model of a scientific article to publish and discuss our results with the rest of the class.
